1. Introduction

Kuhn poker is an extremely simplified form of poker developed by Harold W. Kuhn.


.ti 0
2. The Poker procedure for player and opponent

The Kuhn poker design is based on the following procedure:

.in 6
The game is only for two players.
.br
One player is the client application and the other is the server application.
.br
The player who wants to play connects with the game server using the communication port number 1212.
.br
The client has to specify which player wants to be, the first or the second.

.bp
.in 3
.ti 0
3. The Kuhn poker specification

This section presents the different commands used in the Poker protocol.

.ti 0
3.1. Client Commands Semantics:

.in 3
First, we start defining the commands used by the client:

The commands are the following:

.in 9
.ti 6
START (STRT):

With this command the client can start a game with the server, it has
to be specified in the arguments if the client wants to play as the first
or the second player. 
.br
This command starts the TCP session.

.ti 6
ACTION (ACTN):

This command is used to notify to the server which action does the client
choose at a given state of the game. After every action the client has to
wait for a response unless the game has ended.
.br
There are four possible actions: 
.br
CHECK (CK), BET (BT), CALL (CL) and FOLD (FD)

.ti 6
DISCONNECT (DISC):

This command is used to notify the server that the client wants to end the
TCP session.
.br
.ti 12
(Discussion about this topic is needed).

.bp
.in 3
.ti 0
3.2. Server Commands Semantics:

Now, we define the commands used by the server:

.in 9
.ti 6
CARD (CARD):

This command is used to notify the client which card does it has in this game.
It is also used to show the card held by the server in a showdown (Explanation
of this end and the rules of the game in the section 5).
.br
There are only three cards:
.br
Jack (_K), Queen (_Q), King (_K).

.ti 6
ACTION (ACTN):

This command is used to notify the client which action the server decides to take
in a given state of the game. After every action the server has to wait for a
response unless the game has ended.
.br
There are four possible actions: 
.br
CHECK (CK), BET (BT), CALL (CL) and FOLD (FD)

.ti 6
DISCONNECT (DISC):

This command is used to notify the client that the server is about to end the TCP
session.
.br
.ti 9
(Discussion about this topic needed).

.ti 6
FAIL (FAIL):

This command is used to notify about any error to the client. 
.br
There are only two possible arguments for this command: 
.br
Wrong Action and No Coins. 
.br
The first is used to notify that an action received can't be performed at the given state of the game and the second is used to notify that the client is trying to perform an action which requires more coins than it has.




.bp
.in 3
.ti 0
4. Command Syntax

The commands consist of a command code, sometimes followed by a space and one argument field. 
.br
Command codes are four alphabetic characters. 
.br
Upper and lower case alphabetic characters are to be treated identically. 


Thus, any of the following may represent the STRT command:

.ti 6
STRT Strt strt StRt StRT

This also applies to any symbols representing parameter values.
.br
Argument field is composed for only one argument separated from the command by a space.
.br
An argument is a two digit code, each one being an ASCII character.


The following are the Poker commands (spaces in the text are only for the visualization):

.in 6
STRT <SP> <player>

CARD <SP> <card>

ACTN <SP> <action>

FAIL <SP> <errcode>

DISC

.in 3
The syntax of the above argument fields is given below (using BNF notation where applicable).
.br
The DISCONNECT command does not need any argument.

.in 6
<player>  ::= "P1" | "P2"

<card>    ::= "_J" | "_Q" | "_K"

<action>  ::= "CK" | "BT" | "CL" | "FD"

<errcode> ::= "WA" | "NC"

<SP>      ::= The space character (ASCII code 32)

.bp
.in 3
As explained above each argument is composed by two ASCII characters, for example:
.br
"P1" would be the ASCII code 80 followed by the ASCII code 49.


The following are syntactically correct commands:

.in 6
STRT "P1"

CARD "_K"

ACTN "CK"

FAIL "NC"

.bp
.in 3
.ti 0
5. Examples

Here are some examples of possible games:

Example 1 (Client plays as the first player and the game ends in a showdown):

.in 9
.ti 6
Client (Start as the player 1):
.br
STRT "P1"

.ti 6
Server (Gives card (Queen)):
.br
CARD "_Q"

.ti 6
Client (Action BET):
.br
ACTN "BT"

.ti 6
Server (Action CALL):
.br
ACTN "CL"

.ti 6
Server (Shows card):
.br
CARD "_K"

.in 6
Client (The game has ended and the client disconnects (it can start a new game too)):
.br
.ti 9
DISC


.in 3
Example 2 (Client plays as the second player and the game ends in a fold by the server):

.in 9
.ti 6
Client (Starts as the player 2):
.br
STRT "P2"

.ti 6
Server (Gives card (Jack)):
.br
CARD "_J"

.ti 6
Client (Action BET):
.br
ACTN "BT"

.ti 6
Server (Action FOLD):
.br
ACTN "FD"

.in 6
Client (The game has ended and the client disconnects (it can start a new game too)):
.br
.ti 9
DISC

.bp
.in 3
.ti 0
6. Rules of the game

There are only three cards: King, Queen, Jack.

At first both players put an ante (one coin) in the pot and get one card (they can't see the others).

The first player has to decide if it bets (one coin) or it checks (pass).
.in 6
If the first player checks the second player can check or bet.
.br
If the second player checks the game ends in a showdown (explained below).

.in 3
Aside from which player bet the next player can call or fold.
.in 6
If that player calls it has to put another coin and the game ends in a showdown.
.br
If that player folds the game ends and the other player wins.

.in 3
If the game ends in a showdonwn both players show their cards and the player with the higher card wins.


The order for the cards is: Jack < Queen < King.


The player who wins gets all the coins in the pot.

Discussion

There has to be discussed the topic of the DISCONNECT command (if it is necessary) and also any protocol to check if the server/client works in Big Endian or Little Endian.
