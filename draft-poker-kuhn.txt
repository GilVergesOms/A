INTERNET DRAFT                 POKER KUHN                     22/02/2018


1. Introduction

   Kuhn poker is an extremely simplified form of poker developed by
   Harold W. Kuhn.


2. The Poker procedure for player and opponent

   The Kuhn poker design is based on the following procedure:

      The game is only for two players.
      One player is the client application and the other is the server
      application.
      The player who wants to play connects with the game server using
      the communication port number 1212.
      The client has to specify which player wants to be, the first or
      the second.

      The following graph will define each state and possible actions
      for each player, it goes from top to down starting from the top:

                                    +-----+
                                    | P 1 |
                                    +-----+
                       BET             |            CHECK
                        +--------------+--------------+
                        |                             |
                     +-----+                       +-----+
                     | P 2 |                       | P 2 |
                     +-----+                       +-----+
        CALL            | FOLD       CHECK            |  BET
         +--------------+              +------------------+
         |              |              |                  |
      SHOWDOWN       P1 wins        SHOWDOWN           +-----+
      --------       -------        --------           | P 1 |
                                                       +-----+
                                          FOLD            |  CALL
                                           +--------------+---+
                                           |                  |
                                        P2 wins            SHOWDOWN
                                        -------            --------


      Each state is a decision state or a terminal state. Decision
      states are defined by a box with the player who has to make the
      decision inside, they can lead to one of the two states below
      depending on the action chosen. Terminal states are non-decision
      states where the game ends.

3. The Kuhn poker specification

   This section presents the different commands used in the Poker
   protocol.

3.1. Client Commands Semantics:

   First, we start defining the commands used by the client:

   The commands are the following:

      START (STRT):

         With this command the client can start a game with the server,
         it has to be specified in the arguments if the client wants to
         play as the first or the second player. 

         This command starts the TCP session.

      ACTION (ACTN):

         This command is used to notify to the server which action does
         the client choose at a given state of the game. After every
         action the client has to wait for a response unless the game
         has ended. In a showdown the game ends when the client receives
         the card from the server.

         There are four possible actions for the client: 
         CHECK (CHK), BET (BET), CALL (CAL) and FOLD (FLD).

      DISCONNECT (DISC):

         This command is used to notify the server that the client wants
         to end the TCP session.
            (Discussion about this topic is needed).

3.2. Server Commands Semantics:

   Now, we define the commands used by the server:

      CARD (CARD):

         This command is used to notify the client which card does it
         has in this game. It is also used to show the card held by the
         server in a showdown.

         The argument can only contain one of the following three cards:
         Jack (C_K), Queen (C_Q), King (C_K).

         Note that in a showdown the server will only send the CARD
         command (not an ACTION command followed by the CARD command).

      ACTION (ACTN):

         This command is used to notify the client which action the
         server decides to take in a given state of the game. After
         every action the server has to wait for a response unless the
         game has ended.

         There are three possible actions for the server: 
         CHECK (CHK), BET (BRT) and FOLD (FLD).

         Note that there is not CALL because is used the CARD command
         instead (it leads to a showdown).

      DISCONNECT (DISC):

         This command is used to notify the client that the server is
         about to end the TCP session.

            (Discussion about this topic needed).

      FAIL (FAIL):

         This command is used to notify about any error to the client. 
         There are only two possible arguments for this command: 
         Wrong Action (W_A) and No Coins (N_C).

         The first is used to notify that an action received can't be
         performed at the given state of the game and the second is used
         to notify that the client is trying to perform an action which
         requires more coins than it has.

4. Command Syntax

   The commands consist of a command code, sometimes followed by a space
   and one argument field. 
   Command codes are four alphabetic characters. 
   Upper and lower case alphabetic characters are to be treated
   identically.

   Thus, any of the following may represent the STRT command:

      STRT Strt strt StRt StRT

   This also applies to any symbols representing parameter values.
   Argument field is composed for only one argument separated from the
   command by a space.
   Each argument is composed by three ASCII characters.


   The following are the Poker Kuhn commands (spaces in the text are
   only for the visualization and are not included in the command):

      STRT <SP> <player>

      CARD <SP> <card>

      ACTN <SP> <action>

      FAIL <SP> <errcode>

      DISC

   The syntax of the above argument fields is given below (using BNF
   notation where applicable).
   The DISCONNECT command does not need any argument.

      <player>  ::= "P_1" | "P_2"

      <card>    ::= "C_J" | "C_Q" | "C_K"

      <action>  ::= "CHK" | "BET" | "CAL" | "FLD"

      <errcode> ::= "W_A" | "N_C"

      <SP>      ::= The space character (ASCII code 32)

INTERNET DRAFT                 POKER KUHN                     22/02/2018


   As explained above each argument is composed by two ASCII characters,
   for example:

   "P_1" would be the ASCII code 80 ("P"), followed by the ASCII code 95
   ("_") followed by the ASCII code 49 ("1").


   The following are examples of syntactically correct commands:

      STRT "P_1"

      STRT "P_2"

      CARD "C_K"

      ACTN "CHK"

      FAIL "N_C"

      DISC

5. Examples

   Here are some examples of possible games:

   Example 1 (Client plays as the first player and the game ends in a
   showdown):

      Client (Start as the player 1):
         STRT "P_1"

      Server (Gives card (Queen)):
         CARD "C_Q"

      Client (Action BET):
         ACTN "BET"

      Server (Shows card (Instead of doing action call and then showing
      card)):
         CARD "C_K"

      Client (The game has ended and the client disconnects (it can
      start a new game too)):
         DISC


   Example 2 (Client plays as the second player and the game ends in a
   fold by the player 1):

      Client (Starts as the player 2):
         STRT "P_2"

      Server (Gives card (Jack)):
         CARD "C_J"

      Server (Action CHECK):
         ACTN "CHK"

      Client (Action BET):
         ACTN "BET"

      Server (Action FOLD):
         ACTN "FLD"

      Client (The game has ended and the client disconnects (it can
      start a new game too)):
         DISC

6. Rules of the game

   There are only three cards: King, Queen, Jack.

   At first both players put an ante (one coin) in the pot and get one
   card (they can't see the others).

   The first player has to decide if it bets (one coin) or it checks
   (pass).
      If the first player checks the second player can check or bet.
      If the second player checks the game ends in a showdown (explained
      below).

   Aside from which player bets the next player can call or fold.
      If that player calls it has to put another coin and the game ends
      in a showdown.
      If that player folds the game ends and the other player wins.

   If the game ends in a showdonwn both players show their cards and the
   player with the higher card wins.


   The order for the cards is: Jack < Queen < King.


   The player who wins gets all the coins in the pot.

Discussion

   There has to be discussed the topic of the DISCONNECT command (if it
   is necessary) and also any protocol to check if the server/client
   works in Big Endian or Little Endian.
